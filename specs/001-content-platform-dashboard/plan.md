# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Build an MVP responsive web application that provides a unified dashboard for creators to manage assets across Twitch, TikTok, YouTube and Instagram. The MVP focuses on P1: platform selector, upload, preview, and checklist verification with folder organization and real-time search/filtering. Use a pragmatic tech stack to minimize time-to-MVP while preserving quality and the project's constitution (contract-driven adapters, test-first, observability).

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: JavaScript/TypeScript for frontend (React + Vite) and Node.js (LTS) for backend.
**Primary Dependencies**: React, Vite, Tailwind (UI); Node.js + Fastify (API); SQLite for asset version metadata; object storage for blobs (local dev: filesystem, prod: S3-compatible).
**Storage**: SQLite for metadata/versioning; object storage for asset binaries; CDN for previews (production).
**Testing**: Jest + Testing Library for frontend; Vitest or Jest for backend tests; Playwright for e2e testing.
**Target Platform**: Web (desktop + mobile responsive).
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend + backend).
**Performance Goals**: p95 UI action latency <300ms (non-upload). Real-time search/filtering should return client-side results <100ms for typical per-user datasets; expected dataset size per user: 100 MB (design to handle up to 500 MB with server-side fallback and FTS).
**Constraints**: Use SQLite for metadata/versioning to simplify MVP deployment; resumable uploads via tus protocol for large files; responsive UI across breakpoints.
**Scale/Scope**: MVP aims for small team usage (100s of users) with moderate asset volumes; adapters designed for later scaling.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Based on the repository constitution, the following checks apply:

- Contract-driven adapters required: PASS (plan includes adapter concept for platforms)
- Contract-driven adapters required: PASS (plan includes adapter concept for platforms)
- Test-first requirement: PASS (tests selected; Playwright chosen for e2e)
- Observability & SLOs: PARTIAL (SLOs defined at high level; detailed metrics TBD)
- Data management & storage policy: PASS (SQLite chosen for MVP; production retention/policy details to be defined in Phase 2)

Any PARTIAL items will be resolved during Phase 0 research or marked as NEEDS CLARIFICATION where product decisions are required.

### Source Code (repository root)
<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the placeholder tree below with the concrete layout
  for this feature. Delete unused options and expand the chosen structure with
  real paths (e.g., apps/admin, packages/something). The delivered plan must
  not include Option labels.

## Remaining NEEDS CLARIFICATION (phase 0 targets)

- None. Phase 0 decisions completed: backend = Fastify; e2e = Playwright; expected per-user dataset size = 100 MB (design to 500 MB); resumable uploads = tus protocol.


## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
